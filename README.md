# Mental Health Dashboard

## Overview

The **Mental Health Dashboard** is a data-driven project designed to analyze the impact of remote work on mental health across various industries, roles, and global regions. Using a comprehensive dataset (`Impact_of_Remote_Work_on_Mental_Health.csv`), this repository provides insights into how work location, experience, and work-life balance affect mental health conditions among employees. The dashboard aims to inform HR professionals, organizations, and researchers about trends and risk factors, enabling data-driven decisions for better workplace well-being.
